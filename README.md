# Group 9 Workload Distribution Plan
## Template
We have chosen to pull inspiration from the Caslys Consulting webpage for our website's template. It can be accessed here: https://www.caslys.ca/

The overall style of this website is as follows: 
- a navigation bar present on every page, 
- a header banner indicating which page you're on with a relevant image behind it, 
- a main content block where the majority of text will go,
- a static footer that is consistent across pages.
## Website Purpose
Our website's goal is to pull from each of our expertise to show customers how GIS can be applied to a wide range of fields. 
We will have ~3 general information pages about what our consulting group is, who we are and what services we offer.
It will also have 5 specifc pages that go into detail about how GIS can be applied to the fields of Archaeology, Forestry, Geography, Urban Planning and Habitat Management.
